--- HORRID HALLS --- (CATACRAWLER?)
Targeted ROM size: 16-32K
	-Preferably doesn't need to use Melody board for RAM expansion
			
Possible RAM optimization:
	-Combine the playerX and playerY bytes if possible. 1 byte
	
Each small enemy takes up 16 bytes.
Each medium enemy takes up 64 bytes.
Each large enemy takes up 192 bytes.	

40 total enemies:
16 small enemies would take up exactly 256 bytes of data
16 medium enemies would take up exactly 1K of data
8 large enemies would take up exactly 1.5K of data
This would also take up 40 * 2 = 80 bytes of pointer data
This would also take up 40 bytes of size data
total = 256 + 1024 + 1536 + 80 + 40 = 2936 bytes of enemy data,
	(not accounting for AI and encounter information, which would be stored elsewhere)
	This would also require 6*40 + 40 = 280 bytes of name information, which would have to be stored in the rendering bank.
	As well as another 40 bytes of color information in the rendering bank.
		There does seem to currently be enough room for this...
	-Encounter generation bank needs access to enemy size information

All small enemies graphics and colors go in the same page
Medium enemies graphics and colors are split across 4 pages
Large enemy graphics take up 4 pages, colors take up 2 pages


If each spell effect is <=32 unique frames long, the total would be <=512 bytes of data.
So it should be possible to have this enemy configuration with unique spell effects.
Maybe spell effects can be updated every other frame, or every 4 frames, to create spells that could be longer.
	-Would need to store effect frequency information as well (not necessarily)
	-Ended up storing effect frequency information as part of the advanced effect system
